Description: This .zip includes ~4300 avatars from World of Warcraft. They are 60x60 pixels in dimension and have been image compressed. I enlarged them slightly from the original size and adjusted sharpness and saturation a little bit.

Installation for phpBB 3.2
1. Upload the folder 'World of Warcraft' to /images/avatars/gallery/
2. Purge your board's cache in the ACP
3. Your avatars are now available for use. Enjoy :)

All artwork belongs to Blizzard entertainment. I do not claim ownership of original artwork.
